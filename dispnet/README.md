## Dispnet

Implementation of paper [A Large Dataset to Train Convolutional Networks for Disparity, Optical Flow, and Scene Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02134.pdf)

Notes:

Optical flow estimation - FlowNet (2D)
Disparity estimation - DispNet (depth)
Scene flow estimation - FlowNet + DispNet (3D)
providing depth and 3D motion vector

Datasets provide ground truth optical flow, disparity and disparity change
