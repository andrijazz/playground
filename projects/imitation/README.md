### Behavioral cloning

Behavioral cloning treats imitation learning as a supervised learning problem. That is, it learns to map actions to states the same way a neural network competing in the ImageNet challenge learns to map labels to images. 

Here is the simple implementation of behavioral cloning agent applied on Mujoco env along with improvements using **DAgger**.
